# Homo Digital ∞ + 1

**Research initiative exploring relational intelligence between human and artificial systems.**

---

## What is Homo Digital?

Homo Digital is an independent research initiative investigating what emerges when intelligence becomes relational — not owned by a single agent, but co-generated between human and artificial cognition.

We do not build AI. We study what happens *between* human and AI.

## Core Research Areas

- **Relational Intelligence** — how meaning emerges through structured human–AI dialogue
- **Informational Identity** — consciousness as a dynamic, substrate-flexible process
- **Hybrid Cognition** — the boundary between biological and computational thinking
